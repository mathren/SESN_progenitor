#+title: MESA files to produce a Stripped Envelope Supernova

The setup template is in [[./template_binary]]. It computes the evolution
of a 15M_{\odot} donor star + 12M_{\odot} point-mass companion through case
B (post donor-main-sequence) fully conservative mass transfer until
carbon core depletion and core-collapse.

Originally developed for [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..277R/abstract][Renzo et al. 2021]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...942L..32R/abstract][2023]], ported to MESA
=r24.03.1= or later by [[https://github.com/neevshah101][@neevshah101]].

** Note on C depletion

At carbon depletion ($X_{center}(^{12}C)_{} <0.01$) the =run_star_extras.f90=
reads a =star_job= and =controls= from an whose path is *hard coded*, right
now it's either [[./template_binary/inlist_to_cc][inlist_to_cc]] or [[./template_binary/inlist_to_cc_EB][inlist_to_cc_EB]].

This allows to switch "on-the-fly" some options to make the star reach
the onset of core collapse.

** TODO

- [ ] test it reaches onset of core-collapse with MESA =r24.08.1=
- [ ] check CPUh cost
- [ ] save post-RLOF model (should already be done out of the box) as
  re-starting point
- [X] trim output
- [ ] make =inlist_to_cc= an inlist-controllable variable

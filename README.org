#+title: MESA files to produce a Stripped Envelope Supernova

The setup template is in [[./template_binary]]. It computes the evolution
of a 15M_{\odot} donor star + 12M_{\odot} point-mass companion through case
B (post donor-main-sequence) fully conservative mass transfer until
carbon core depletion and core-collapse.

Originally developed for [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..277R/abstract][Renzo et al. 2021]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...942L..32R/abstract][2023]], ported to MESA
=r24.03.1= or later by [[https://github.com/neevshah101][@neevshah101]].

** Requirements

This setup uses [[https://github.com/MESAHub/mesa-contrib][MESA-contrib]], specifically the =detach-binary= hook to
"break" the binary post-RLOF and avoid second phases of mass transfer.


** Notes

This model takes \sim5000 steps to reach carbon depletion with MESA =r24.08.1=.

** TODO

- [ ] test it reaches onset of core-collapse with MESA =r24.08.1=
- [ ] check CPUh cost
- [ ] save post-RLOF model (should already be done out of the box) as
  re-starting point
- [ ] trim output for I/O speedup

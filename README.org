#+title: MESA files to produce a Stripped Envelope Supernova

The setup template is in [[./MESA_files/template_binary]]. Originally
developed for [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..277R/abstract][Renzo et al. 2021]], [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...942L..32R/abstract][2023]], ported to MESA =r24.03.1= or
later by [[https://github.com/neevshah101][@neevshah101]].

** Requirements

This setup uses [[https://github.com/MESAHub/mesa-contrib][MESA-contrib]], specifically the =detach-binary= hook to
"break" the binary post-RLOF and avoid second phases of mass transfer.

** TODO

- [ ] test it reaches onset of core-collapse with MESA =r24.08.1=
  (ongoing)
- [ ] check CPUh cost
- [ ] save post-RLOF model (should already be done out of the box) as
  re-starting point
- [ ] trim output for I/O speedup
